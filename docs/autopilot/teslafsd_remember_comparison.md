While both NVIDIA’s ReMEmbR system and Tesla’s Autopilot make heavy use of neural networks for perception and reasoning over visual data, they’re designed for fundamentally different tasks and operate on very different time scales:

1. **Purpose and Domain**

   * **ReMEmbR** (Retrieval-augmented Memory for Embodied Robots) is built to give robots a *long-horizon semantic memory* of what they’ve seen—storing and indexing captions and embeddings from video over hours or days, then retrieving and reasoning over that memory to answer questions or plan multi-step tasks in an environment ([NVIDIA Developer][1], [nvidia-ai-iot.github.io][2]).
   * **Tesla Autopilot** is an advanced driver-assist system (ADAS) aimed at *real-time vehicle control*, using a suite of cameras (and formerly radar/ultrasonics) plus an onboard computer to perceive lanes, other road users, and obstacles over time horizons of seconds, then immediately translate that perception into steering, braking, and acceleration commands ([Wikipedia][3], [Think Autonomous][4]).

2. **Memory and Temporal Scope**

   * **ReMEmbR** explicitly builds a *retrieval-augmented memory* in a vector database: it captions video frames, embeds those captions along with time and position metadata, and later performs semantic queries against that accumulated data. It’s designed for questions like “How long were you in the north corridor yesterday?” or “Where did you see the red toolbox three hours ago?” ([arXiv][5]).
   * **Autopilot’s** “memory” is a short-term temporal fusion of recent frames (on the order of a few seconds) for smooth control: Tesla’s HydraNet architecture fuses multi-camera images into a “super-image” and then applies time-fusion networks (3D CNNs, RNNs, or transformers) to maintain situational awareness, but it doesn’t index or retrieve past events beyond what’s needed for immediate driving decisions ([Think Autonomous][4]).

3. **Retrieval-Augmented vs. End-to-End Control**

   * **ReMEmbR** is a *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG) pipeline: it separates memory building from querying and leverages large language models (LLMs) to reason over retrieved facts.
   * **Tesla Autopilot** uses an *end-to-end-trained* neural network stack: perception, prediction, and planning are tightly integrated into a single pipeline designed for continuous control, without a distinct retrieval database for long-term memory.

4. **Openness and Deployment**

   * **ReMEmbR** is fully *open source* and intended for research and general robotics applications.
   * **Tesla Autopilot** is a *proprietary* system embedded in Tesla vehicles, continuously updated via over-the-air software to improve its real-time driving capabilities.

---

**Bottom line:**
At a high level, both systems apply deep learning to visual data and incorporate some notion of temporal reasoning, but they differ in scope (hours vs. seconds), architecture (RAG with vector DB vs. end-to-end control net), and application (robot question-answering vs. vehicle automation). Their overlap is limited to shared AI fundamentals—beyond that, they serve very different needs.
