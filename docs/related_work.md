# Related Work: Comparing ReMEmbR to Existing Approaches

## Introduction

This document provides a comparative analysis of ReMEmbR against related work in robot memory systems, embodied question answering, language and navigation, and large language models in robotics. Understanding these relationships helps contextualize ReMEmbR's contributions and identify potential areas for future integration.

## Embodied Question Answering

### OpenEQA

**Key Similarities:**

### Traditional EQA Systems

Traditional Embodied Question Answering systems (Das et al., 2018; Wijmans et al., 2019) differ from ReMEmbR in several ways:

**Key Differences:**
- Focus on navigation to answer questions rather than reasoning over past observations

### Vision-and-Language Navigation

Traditional VLN approaches (Anderson et al., 2018; Krantz et al., 2023) differ from ReMEmbR in several key aspects:

**Key Differences:**

## Conclusion

ReMEmbR represents a significant advancement in long-horizon memory systems for robot navigation, addressing key limitations of existing approaches:

1. **Scalability**: Unlike fixed-context approaches, ReMEmbR can handle arbitrarily long histories through its retrieval-based architecture.

2. **Multi-Modal Integration**: ReMEmbR effectively integrates visual, spatial, and temporal information, unlike many systems that focus on just one or two modalities.

3. **Practical Deployment**: ReMEmbR has been successfully deployed on real robots with reasonable computational requirements, demonstrating its practical utility.

4. **Comprehensive Reasoning**: ReMEmbR supports a wider range of question types and reasoning capabilities than specialized systems focused on specific tasks.

Future work could explore integrating ReMEmbR with complementary approaches, such as combining its long-horizon memory capabilities with the planning strengths of systems like Inner Monologue or the navigation capabilities of LM-Nav.
